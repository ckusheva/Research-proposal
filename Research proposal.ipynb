    "This dataset catogorises the projects on the kickstarter platform into 15 different categories: 'Publishing', 'Film & Video','Music', 'Food', 'Design', 'Crafts', 'Games', 'Comics', 'Fashion', 'Theater', 'Art', 'Photography', 'Technology', 'Dance', 'Journalism'. One of the conclusions that I  came to was that the projects with the most backers fall into the 'Games' category. However, the projects which has least abckers pledging funds were in the 'Dance' category. However, is this a proof that if a project falls into a 'Dance' category, it has less chances to be successful due to people's less interest in this field? A ture correlation can not be confirmed unless we compare the most funded category 'Games' to the 'Dance' category and see if their mean is significantly different.\n",

    "In looking at the setup for the A/B test, I would select a sample group of 1000 backers from the list of all backers that invested in a kickstart project before. However, I would exclude the backers that invested in either projects falling into a 'Dance' or a'Games' category so the test wouldn't be biased. I would then divide the sample group in half so that each half is similar to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "After our sameple is determined, we will send emails to both groups promoting 10 projects - 5 from the 'dance' category and 5 from the 'games' category. The email will contain a title showing the category of the project, the name of the project and a short summary alongside a link leading to the page of the projects on the kickstarted platform. Those two types of projects should have similar duration , similar target amount and should be released at approximately the same time. They will be carefully selected from all the projects so that they fit the criteria. Before sending the email, we will reach out to each of the projects' owners, asking for a permission to use their project in order to test our hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two weeks after the emails are sent out, the data will be collected showing how many backers invested in each of the two types of projects. Of course, the link provided will help us track how many of the total backers that invested in each of the projects are informed about this project via the emails we sent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that all factors are equal between the two groups, I would hypothise that the number of the backers invested in the projects falling to the 'Games' category will be more than the backers invested in the projects falling into the 'Dance' category. "
